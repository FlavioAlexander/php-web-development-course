This project will create a website for Electrical and Computer Engineering professors as Simpson’s characters. 
All pages, including the home page will have the same basic structure. The top tab is a simple banner. The left
 side has a navigation menu linking to all the other pages. A special link named “Log In” will prompt the user 
 for log in credentials. Two types of users may be able to access “restricted information.” They are students 
 and administrators. The log In prompt will requires both username and password. If the user is validated to 
 be an administrator he/she will be able to add or delete professor profiles.
