This project will create a website for Electrical and Computer Engineering professors as Simpson's characters. 
All pages, including the home page will have the same basic structure. The top tab is a simple banner with a 
navigation menu underneath linking to all the other pages. A special link named <strong>Log In </strong>will prompt the user 
for log in credentials. Two types of users may be able to access <strong>restricted information </strong>They are students 
and administrators. The log In prompt will requires both username and password. If the user is validated to 
be an administrator he/she will be able to add or delete professor profiles.
