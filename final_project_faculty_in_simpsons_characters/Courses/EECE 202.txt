Intro To Computer Programming; It introduces programming using C++. The topics of the course include  primitive and user-defined data types, searching and sorting, classes and objects, pointers and linked lists, recursion, stacks and queues however if you don't want a career in programming the class is a waste of time. This course offers hands on experience with very dull material. It suppose to serve as a building block for programming but really creates a blockage for enjoying the department.
