Fundamentals of Electrical System Analysis; This is a core class for understanding electrical engineering with that being said you will never need it. You will learn techniques called Superposotion, Thevenin, and Norton Equivalent which came from a  bunch of grumpy old guys that wanted to solve the same thing in their own way. You will also learn about First and Second Order transient analysis whatever that means. The most useful thing you will get from this class is the fact you will have to learn Pspice which is very outdated but useful in checking your answers.
