Capstone Design II; This course is the continuation of Capstone Design I and where you have to actually implement the project. This means the project has to be done and ready to present by the end of the semester. So in the beginning of the semester you still think you will bang this out quickly because it looks easy. So lets go 2 months in the semester, at this point you realize you know nothing about your part of the project and your freaking out to finish the project. You think back to last semester and how you should have started the project then because you are screwed now. So you cram all of you time to finish this project and you will continue to question why did I choose this major? In the end either it will work or not but it doesn't matter to you because you just want to be done.
