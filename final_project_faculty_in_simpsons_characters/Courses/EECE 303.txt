Signals and Systems I; This course is probably the most important course that you will need to take however they can't seem to find someone who can teach it. You are suppose to learn modeling and analysis of continuous-time systems. Convolution of signals and representation of linear time invariant systems. Fourier series and the Fourier Transform and its applications. The only thing that happens in this class is that one signal comes in one ear and out the other. If you want to catch up on some sleep that you missed then this is the class you should take because even if you are listening you won't understand anything.
