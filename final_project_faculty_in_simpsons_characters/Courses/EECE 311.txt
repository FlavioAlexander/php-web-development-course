Applied Electromagnetics; This course is an introduction to waves and their applications. The topics are electromagnetic fields, transmission lines, fiber optics, and telecommunication systems. The most crucial part of the course are maxwell's equations. They are 4 fundamental equations governing electromagnetism basically they are everything. The course keeps you asking why did Maxwell do this to us. Between the theory and its applications the only magnetic force you see it the one the course creates between you and your social life. The course will make you question all the reason why you wanted to become an electrical/computer engineer. If you make it to the end just remind maxwell is everywhere.
