Probability and Statistics; This is by far the hardest class taught in electrical/computer engineering which really does a number on your gpa. The course covers basic concepts of probability theory, discrete and continuous random variables and their distributions, moments and characteristic functions. Empirical distribution functions. Parameter estimation and measures of their quality. If you love non-stop homework and tests that are very difficult, you should take this class. The only probability that you will learn is the probability of you passing the course. As for the statistics part lets hope you don't become a statistic of students that drop out of college.
