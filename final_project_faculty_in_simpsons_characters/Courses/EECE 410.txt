Capstone Design I; This course is suppose to encompass everything you learned in electrical and computer engineering so you may develop a project related to electrical and computer engineering. You will work in teams with the help of the professor however, each time the professor tries to explain anything, it never helps and makes things worse. You will spend a lot of time talking about what you should do but really never getting anything done. When the semester is coming to an end you realize you don't have the design of the project done so you half-ass something to make it seem like you were working all semster.
