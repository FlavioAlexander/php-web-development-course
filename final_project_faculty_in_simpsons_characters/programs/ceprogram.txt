Computer engineering is the combination of core courses in electrical engineering and computer science, the computer engineering curriculum prepares students to enter this challenging new field. If you don't mind many hours in front of a computer screen and work on your eyes then hopefully you will enjoy the migraines from all the assignments. Also since you are basically learning two majors you might as well say goodbye to your significant other and learn to love your computer.The best part of the major is that when you tell someone that you are a computer engineer they will continuously ask you to fix their computer.
