Electrical engineering ranges from design of solid state devices, to the design of communication systems or large scale power generating equipment plans, to meet society’s accelerating demand for clean energy. Everything I just mentioned may not be true. The real course descripition is that electrical engineering is a lot of rusty material that  causes ruckus in your brain right before an exam. You spend lots of hours doing work to learn Ohm's law only, to find out that there is a computer program that does it for you. However if you enjoy long walks on the beach and a lot of free time to work on other things don't join the electrical engineering department. One thing that you will learn that is vital to our courses is that you don't get something from nothing this is New York baby.
