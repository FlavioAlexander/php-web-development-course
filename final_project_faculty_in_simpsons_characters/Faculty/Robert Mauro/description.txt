Moe is characterized by a short, violent temper (particularly aiming a makeshift shotgun at customers), coupled with homicidal and suicidal tendencies and a proclivity towards obsessive behaviors. He has low self-esteem and is suicidal, suggesting he may suffer from Major Depressive Disorder. He has an annual Christmas tradition of attempted suicide, but his attempts are comically unsuccessful (landing on a hot-air balloon after jumping out of a plane, for example). He's called the suicide hotline so many times that they've blocked his number.
Moe is especially bitter, keeping an enemies list nearly identical to that of Richard Nixon, with the addition of Barney. He has assumed a leading role in many of Springfield's angry mobs (including, at times, starting mob riots for the sake of doing so), and kidnapping Talking Heads vocalist David Byrne. He has also engaged in bizarre behavior, such as shooting at Carl, robbing Homer of expensive pants, keeping Hans Moleman under his bar's in a subterranean torture chamber, perpetrating insurance fraud, and stalking various townspeople.
