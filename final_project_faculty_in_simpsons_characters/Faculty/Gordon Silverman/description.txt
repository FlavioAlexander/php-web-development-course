Abe is a World War II veteran who was later sent to the Springfield Retirement Castle by Homer. He is known for his long, rambling, and often inaccurate stories and general incompetence. Almost all of Grampa's biographical information is supplied by himself. Many of his stories seem to be wildly inaccurate, often physically or historically impossible, and occasionally inconsistent, even with each other, suggesting that Abe is senile (though his reaction to Bart's reaction to one of his stories implies that he is aware that he is being inconsistent). As such, all information provided is taken with a grain of salt. He suffers from sporadic narcoleptic attacks. Every day he calls horrible and he waits for his death, which will probably not happen during the Simpsons episodes and seasons
