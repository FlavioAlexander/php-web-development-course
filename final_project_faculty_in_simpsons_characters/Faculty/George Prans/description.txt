Burns is Springfield's richest and most powerful citizen. His net worth has been stated to be in the billions and in one instance was pegged at exactly $1,800,037,022. Yet he once lost his entire fortune and at another time slipped to "only" $996 million ($996,036,000), leading to his expulsion from Billionaire Camp. Burns is very elderly and physically frail; regardless, he employs his evil, cruel, bitter, cynical, heartless and greedy tactics to get what he wants.
