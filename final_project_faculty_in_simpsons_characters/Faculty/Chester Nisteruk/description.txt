Although appearing elderly, Hans Moleman once claimed that he was only 31 years old, but due to his heavy drinking, he appears much older but in a different episode it reveals that he is over 70 so his actual age is uncertain. He has cataracts and is almost entirely blind (which has severely impaired his reading ability) and has used medical marijuana. He carries a brown cane with him everywhere, which was once shown to contain a hidden sword. He is also known to be a war veteran.
