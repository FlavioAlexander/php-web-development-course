Gerald Ford was the 38th President of the United States, serving from 1974 to 1977. He has the historical distinction of being the only person to serve as both Vice-President and President without being elected to either office. Ford was appointed Vice-President when Spiro Agnew (who served as Vice-President under Richard Nixon) resigned in October 1973, and succeeded to the Presidency when Nixon resigned in August 1974. In spite of his past athletic accomplishments (such as playing football in college), Ford acquired a reputation for being clumsy when he tripped and fell down the steps of Air Force One in 1975. He passed away on December 26, 2006.
