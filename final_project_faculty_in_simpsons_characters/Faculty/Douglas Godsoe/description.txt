Arnold "Arnie" Pye is a disgruntled, somewhat eccentric helicopter traffic reporter for Springfield’s KBBL-TV (Channel 6). His segments are titled Arnie Pye with Arnie in the Sky. In some of the early episodes, he was referred to as "Bill Pye". His accent implies that he may have originated from New York or New Jersey. His name is a play on "Ernie Pyle", a famous news reporter.He has an apparent dislike of anchorman Kent Brockman, with whom he often gets into arguments on the air, because Kent is a much bigger and luckier star.
