Apu is generally polite towards his customers, always saying thank you. He is also a dutiful worker to the point of being a virtual workaholic, often spending more time at his workplace than even with his own family, to Manjula's irritation, especially when she finds out that in America, workplaces normally have weekends off, a practice that Apu eventually never told her.

However, he has had some negative traits, sometimes manipulating customers into buying things they don't really need (sometimes into things which may be potentially life threatening and even fatal), and also sometimes having some snideness slip out in his polite greetings. He has a bit of a paranoid nature, as evidenced by his once jumping behind a counter and then shouting threats to Bart and Lisa who were walking in to investigate a robbery that Krusty was framed for, and at least twice went up to the roof and started shooting his rifle at potential customers. Apu is also not immune to practicing the customary traits of Springfieldians, being backwardsness, myopia, and even to outright stupidity, having been seen flocking to various questionable trends and even participate in various mobbings.
