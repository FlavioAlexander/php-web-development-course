He is the godfather of the Springfield Mafia who is an old man who appears to be in his 60's. He is one step above Fat Tony and tried to kill Homer and Krusty. In Homie the Clown, his only major appearance, when Krusty opened his own clown college he got into a conflict with The Springfield Mafia. However in the mean time Homer graduated Krusty's Clown College (formerly Willie Nelson's home) and got respect just for looking like Krusty. Apparently, it went too far when The Springfield Mafia thought Homer was actually Krusty and afterwards the Real Krusty came and the mafia decided to kill both of them unless they do a mini tricycle trick. Homer and Krusty worked together to do it and succeeded and avoided death, as well as getting their due from Krusty.
