She is very aggressive toward anyone whom she deems a threat to her business, as she once warned Marge to "stay off the West Side!" and said to Gil, "Were you talking about the West Side?" He responds, "No, Cookie, I swear! I'm-I'm scared of you!"

Both Cookie and Lindsey Naegle often look for a man. She once offered to have Homer move to her house. She once had a relationship with Mayor Quimby and they had a son, but Quimby gave him to one of his bodyguards, so she was one of the 37 women filing paternity suits against Quimby.

Cookie went to Camp Land-A-Man with Marge, Helen Lovejoy, Luann Van Houten, Patty and Selma when she was a child. Marge had arranged a date with Homer, but he didn't appear, so Marge went out of the camp. Cookie told everyone at the camp about it and that Marge was pregnant.

She rented Homer the apartment he stayed in in Waverly Hills.
